# Discord_Economy_Python
 
Note: This is a work in progress

This is a simple economy python bot created, with extra features added. Feel free to copy and change the bot as you please. Do not that for this bot intents are needed, but if you do not know what they are or want intents, simply delete any statements with intent with them.

When a user types a message, they get a dollar and has a 20% chance of getting a lockpick.

The bot prefix is e!, and there are currently a balance, bank, bid, steal and browse function.

balance: show user's wallet balance, lockpicks and bank amount

bank (number): banks in (number) into bank, give negative amount to withdrawl 

steal @(mention): steals form the mentioned user, and take 1-100 dollars

bid: bid on an 'NFT', highest bid will own the NFT and the previous bidder's money is returned

browse (filename): will send the image of the file if it exists in the NFTS folder

If you do want to add more images to bid on, add the image into the NFTS folder and run ntfinitialise.py



More features and polish will be added soon.
